                   <h2>I will being in College...</h2>
                   <p>Ever since I can rememeber I always liked electonics especially computers, so knew I wanted to do something related to Computers in college. I ended up 
                       choosing Computer Engineering as my degree. I enjoyed it for the most part, even though I wasnt a huge fan of the math classes I was good enough
                        to understand it. Some of the things I learnt about includes Networking, Java, Databases, some HTML too, but I unfortunately at the time was more interested
                        in the hardware side of Computers so that's what I focused on the most. Which I kind of regret now.</p>

                   <h2> World of Warcraft</h2>
                   <p>During my time in college in 2007 I started playing this very popular Computer video game called World of Warcraft. A friend from highschool recommended it and I loved
                    it. I spent so many hours playing it, which unfortunately made me loose track a bit of more important things like my degree but I have a special reason why. 
                    World of Warcraft will always have a special place in my heart, not because I loved it so much (which I did), but because that's where I met my Wife. 
                    One day I was just doing quests to level up in Stonetalon Mountains, I had a quest to kill a rare monster and she needed it too so we did it together, and from 
                    there on we kept doing quests together and talking while playing the game for many years, and now we're married. When I think about it, it always makes me think
                    about how lucky I was to be there that day...  </p>

                   <h2>Meeting wife in person</h2>
                   <p>After many years of playing World of Warcraft together me and my wife finally got the oportunity to meet in person in 2014. It took a while mostly because it was though
                    to get a tourist Visa to come visit the United States. I had a family trip to Florida, so she went down there to meet me. We went to Universal Studios together 
                    and then met a couple more times at the Florida mall. We did not get to spend too much time together besides that because we were both on Family trips </p>

                   <h2>Moving to America and getting married</h2>
                   <p>A year after we met in 2015 I got the opportunity to come to KC and be with my wife for a little over a month. She took me to her favourite places in KC and also
                    I got to meet her family. During this Trip I proposed to her and we decided we wanted to live together. So when I returned to Venezuela we started the process of 
                    immigration so I could come to the United States permanently. Luckily it all went smooth and did not take too long, so in January 2016 I moved permanently to 
                    the United States and we got married on February 27th of 2016.</p>

                   <h2>Working</h2>
                   <p>Once I was in the United States I could not legally work until I got my work permit. During this time I kept working on a website called Humanatic where I reviewed
                    car dealership calls, I basically wrote down explaining what happened in each call. I did this before moving to get a bit of money to afford trips to the US. I did this 
                    for a few months, until I finally got my work permit. And then I found my first job at a company called Support.com where I was a remote support tech over the phone for
                    Comcast customers. I did this job for about 6 months, until December 2016 I found what I consider my very first real job at AMC Theaters headquarters in Leawood, Kansas. 
                    I worked as a Help Desk Analyst providing technical support over the phone to all of the AMC Theaters in the United States. After 2 years of working at AMC I decided to
                    move on and found a similar job at a company called ScriptPro, where I provide technical support over the phone to ScriptPro customers.</p>

                    <h2>LaunchCode!</h2>
                    <p>For a long time I've wanted to get back into programming, one of my wife's uncle told me about LaunchCode and how it would probably be great for me. After 
                    reading up about it I immediately applied for the CS50x here in KC but I unfortunately did not get in. I tried learning on my own which I did learn a bit of Python.
                    However its very tough for me to learn on my own like that which is why I knew getting into an in person class environment would be extremely benecificial to me. I tried
                    to apply one more time to the first LC101 but I unfortunately did not get in either. I was quite dissapointed because I felt like I did so well in the assignment. I even
                    emailed LaunchCode asking if I did OK in the assesment I was told I probably would've gotten in if I answered one more question right which was really tough to hear.
                    But luckily third time was the charm for me, I finally got in and here I am, enjoying learning so much. Its been though but I dont regret it one bit I am just excited
                    to continue learning more and hopefully I can become a professional developer in the future!</p>
